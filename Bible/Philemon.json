        "Philemon 1:1": "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith,",
        "Philemon 1:2": "And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house:",
        "Philemon 1:3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
        "Philemon 1:4": "I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you,",
        "Philemon 1:5": "Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints;",
        "Philemon 1:6": "That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ.",
        "Philemon 1:7": "For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother.",
        "Philemon 1:8": "And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right,",
        "Philemon 1:9": "Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus:",
        "Philemon 1:10": "My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains,",
        "Philemon 1:11": "Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me:",
        "Philemon 1:12": "Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart:",
        "Philemon 1:13": "Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place:",
        "Philemon 1:14": "But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart.",
        "Philemon 1:15": "For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever;",
        "Philemon 1:16": "No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord.",
        "Philemon 1:17": "If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself.",
        "Philemon 1:18": "If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account.",
        "Philemon 1:19": "I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life.",
        "Philemon 1:20": "So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ.",
        "Philemon 1:21": "Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say.",
        "Philemon 1:22": "And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you.",
        "Philemon 1:23": "Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love;",
        "Philemon 1:24": "And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers.",
        "Philemon 1:25": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it."
